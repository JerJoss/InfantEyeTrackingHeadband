While most studies analyzing infant visual attention use methods varying from annotations of videos from head-mounted cameras, to fixed screen-based eye-tracking setups, increasing interest has been shown towards solutions that would pair the precision of eye-tracking with the free mobility offered by video annotation. This would allow infant research to gather high-quality visual attention data in naturalistic situations, which might yield results more representative of real-world infant environments. For this purpose, various forms of portable eye-tracking devices have been developed and used to study infant cognition, along with frequently time-consuming infant-adapted calibration procedures. Recently, the advent of calibration-free lightweight wearable eye-tracking systems developed by Pupil Labs© is offering new and simpler ways to study infant visual attention with the advantages of deep-learning calibration and miniaturization. However, despite a wide variety of wearing accessories being offered by the company, no suitable option currently exists for infants younger than 2 years old. In this paper, instructions will be provided to build a new wearing accessory for Pupil Labs’ Neon eye-tracking module adapted to 3 to 24 months-old infants, along with usage instructions.
